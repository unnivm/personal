SQL 
====

3: I do not kow how to do it in MYSQL. But the logic is split the column values and append a carriage return to
   the end of each and every string. Fires a sql and store the result into a cursor. Then combine the split
   string values into a cursor as well (if possible) and return it as an OUT parameter.
     
4: I did not understand the requirement fully though I have coded sql for it based on my understanding.
